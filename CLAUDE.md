# Claude Code — Workspace Rules

@AGENTS.md

## Environment Setup

```bash
source .agent/scripts/set_git_identity_env.sh "Claude Code Agent" "roland+claude-code@rolker.net" "<your-model-id>"
```

Replace `<your-model-id>` with your actual model ID from your system prompt
(e.g., `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`). The 3-arg form skips all
detection and uses exactly what you provide — do NOT edit `framework_config.sh`.

## Tool Mapping

The AGENTS.md "Tool Usage" section applies to all frameworks. In Claude Code,
the dedicated tools are:

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| `ls`, `find` | Glob |
| `grep`, `rg` | Grep |
| `cat`, `head`, `tail` | Read |
| `sed`, `awk` | Edit |
| `echo >`, heredoc redirection | Write |

These are auto-approved and don't consume permission prompts.

**Enforced by hook**: `.claude/hooks/block-bash-tool-mapping.sh` blocks
Bash calls that match the simple cases — `cat <file>`, `head [-N] <file>`,
`tail [-N] <file>`, `find <path> ...` (any filesystem enumeration without
an operational flag), `sed -n 'SCRIPT' <file>`, and `sed -i ...` (including
combined short-flag clusters like `-ni`). Pipes, redirects, heredocs, and
operational flags (`head -c`, `tail -f`, `find -exec/-delete/-mtime/...`,
plain `sed 's/x/y/'` without `-i` or `-n`) pass through unchanged. Blocks
are logged to `~/.claude/tool-mapping-blocks.jsonl` so we can measure how
often the hook fires.

## Claude-Specific Notes

- Makefile `.PHONY` targets (excluding `help`) are available as `/make_*` slash commands
  (e.g., `/make_build`, `/make_test`, `/make_dashboard`). After adding or removing eligible
  `.PHONY` targets, run `make generate-skills` to regenerate the slash commands.

- **Worktree entry**: prefer `/start-task --issue <N> --type <workspace|project>` (or
  `--skill <name> --type workspace`) over the two-step `worktree_create.sh` +
  `source worktree_enter.sh` flow. The slash command wraps the policy scripts and
  enters via the native `EnterWorktree` tool, so the session lands in the worktree
  with proper cache coherence in one tool call. All policy still applies (issue
  checks, branch naming, `--plan-file`, `--workflow`, skill allowlist). Codex /
  Gemini agents stay on the script flow — `/start-task` is Claude Code only.
