# .agent/scripts/_resolve_work_plans_dir.sh
# Shared helper for resolving the per-issue work-plans directory.
#
# Source this file from other scripts:
#   source "$SCRIPT_DIR/_resolve_work_plans_dir.sh"
#
# Exposes: resolve_work_plans_dir <issue-number>
#   On success: echoes absolute path to .agent/work-plans/issue-<N>/ on stdout.
#   On failure: prints error to stderr and returns 1.
#
# Resolution rules (in order):
#   1. If $WORK_PLANS_DIR_OVERRIDE is set (callers export this after parsing
#      --work-plans-dir), return it verbatim.
#   2. Else if $WORKTREE_ISSUE equals the requested issue number, return
#      "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.agent/work-plans/issue-<N>".
#   3. Else abort with remediation guidance pointing at worktree_enter.sh.
#
# Rationale: see issue #147. Using `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` without a
# worktree check lets scripts silently write per-issue artifacts into `main`
# when invoked from the wrong tree. Callers source this helper to fail loudly
# instead.
