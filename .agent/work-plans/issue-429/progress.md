**Issue**: #429

### Scope Assessment

**Well-scoped?** No, as one change. The acceptance ("reaches the merge checkpoint without hand steps") crosses at least four independent mechanisms: where a package issue's records live, worktree creation and phase dispatch inside a package worktree, the merge gate for a package pull request, and the skill/design text. Split proposed below.
**Right repo?** Yes. The work is in `run-issue`, `dispatch_phase.sh`, `merge_pr.sh`, the records lookup and the design text, all workspace. A session at the project root does it (ADR-0016/0018 session-root rule), so no cross-root work is needed.
**Serves**: the project-rooted `/run-issue` path of the Direction (acceptance sequence step "project11 after 10-24"), `docs/design.md#sessions-and-roots` and `#worktrees`.
**Design picture?** Changes [Worktrees] (the Records bullet and Target) and [Review loop and timeline] (package pull requests in the merge gate and `_gate_record`). The change log row is part of each part.
**Dependencies**: #393 (records lookup, open, Part of #332, already lists "Package-repository issues have no timeline today and stay so" under Unsettled; this issue reverses that, so #393 must be amended or this issue becomes its first consumer). #265 (open, "Step 5: hosted projects" roadmap entry) overlaps on `--type project` end to end.

What the design already records (quoted, so the plan asks only what is open):

- Package worktrees: ADR-0012 (`worktree_repos`, `worktree_env`; the `.worktree-repos` manifest per worktree; `ros2_colcon` requires `--issue owner/repo#N` plus `--layer` and `--package-repos`; the issue's own repo gets `feature/issue-<N>`). Design, Sessions and roots: "A multi-repo project's root is its registered hosting directory, never a package repository nested in it", and worktrees "live under their root". So the session-root rule already allows a package worktree from a project-rooted session; only `run-issue`'s Scope text says it does not.
- Where the timeline lives: Worktrees, Records: "An issue in a package repository (`--issue owner/repo#N`, worked in a package worktree) has no timeline: a package worktree is a folder of several repositories, not one repository, so `merge_pr.sh` posts its gate record on the pull request". Same section, general rule: records are "committed in the repository that owns the issue ... on the issue's feature branch, under `.agent/work-plans/issue-N/` (owner decision 2026-10-09, C3)". These two sentences conflict for a package issue: the owning repository is the package repository, which is a real git worktree inside the package worktree, yet the design says no timeline. The loop cannot run without one: Review loop, "`.agent/work-plans/issue-<N>/progress.md` is the only place loop state lives".
- Which repository the pull request targets: not written for packages. The general rule, "Issues and PRs live in whichever repo owns the code being changed" (AGENTS.md), gives the package repository. The Merge gate text already says "Project and package pull requests are report-only", and `_gate_record` already posts on the pull request when no worktree can commit the entry.
- Records settings (Worktrees Target, #393): `location` project|outside, `tracking` untracked|project|repo, only (project, project) honoured today. The records location "counts as the root's own", so a session writing records there keeps the session-root rule.

**Real gap found**: for a package issue (project, project) means the project's own repository, but a multi-repository project's hosting directory is usually not a git repository carrying the issue's code, and the package repository is the owner. Writing `.agent/work-plans/` into a third-party package repository is a footprint on a repository that did not opt in (owner goal 2026-09-23: "don't force conventions on projects"). That choice is the one thing the design leaves open.

### Principle Alignment

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Put each thing at the level it applies to | Action needed | Mechanism text and the synthetic sandbox must name no project; the acceptance run against a real project is a separate, owner-run step, not a test (design Rules row). |
| Enforcement over documentation | Watch | The gate is report-only for package pull requests. Decide in the split whether this stays so; do not leave it unstated. |
| A change includes its consequences | Action needed | `run-issue/SKILL.md` Scope, the Worktrees Records bullet and Target, the Merge gate bullet, `merge_pr.sh` line references and the design change log all change. |
| Capture decisions / Verify before claiming | Watch | Script line numbers cited in the design (merge_pr.sh 810, 853, 926, 939) drift; refresh them. |
| Improve the system, not only the output | OK | Matches the owner's path: project11 development from a project-rooted session. |

### ADR Applicability

| ADR | Triggered | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0003 project-agnostic workspace | Yes | Tests use a synthetic multi-repository sandbox; skills and scripts name no project. |
| 0011 adapter contract | Yes | Generic scripts must not branch on project type; package awareness goes through the `.worktree-repos` manifest and the adapter verbs. |
| 0012 worktree composition | Yes | Package worktree creation is done; the issue builds on it. `run-issue` stays type-agnostic and reads the manifest, not the type. |
| 0013 progress.md vocabulary | Yes | Correlation key is the issue number only; `owner/repo#N` needs a rule for the directory name `issue-N` so two package repositories' issue 7 do not collide. |
| 0014 in-process handoff | Yes | `dispatch_phase.sh` must start the sub-agent in the package worktree and pass the records path. |
| 0016 / 0018 session roots, plugin delivery | Yes | Session works only under its root; `session_root.sh` refuses a package repository as a root, so the run starts at the hosting directory and the worktree is entered with `cd`. |
| 0017 design is the current picture | Yes | Update Worktrees, Review loop, Merge gate and the change log in the same changes. |

### Consequences

- `run-issue/SKILL.md` Scope: the two out-of-scope entries are rewritten (acceptance asks for it); also the paragraph near line 68 about a package worktree giving a different skill-prefix answer.
- Worktrees Records bullet and Target (design.md ~440-450 and the Target list), Review loop bullet on `_gate_record`, Merge gate bullet "Project and package pull requests are report-only", the `merge_pr.sh` and `worktree_create.sh` rows of the script table.
- #393 text: "Package-repository issues ... stay so" is reversed; its mechanism 1 call sites (`progress_append.sh:87`, `review_progress.sh`, `dispatch_phase.sh`, `merge_pr.sh`, `_resolve_work_plans_dir.sh`) are the same sites this issue needs.
- Tests: a synthetic sandbox of a hosting directory plus two package repositories with bare remotes; none exists for `merge_pr.sh` against a package pull request today, check `.agent/scripts/tests/` for the nearest.
- The issue number key: the directory `issue-N` and `progress_append.sh --issue` need a package-qualified form, or the records live per repository so the number is unambiguous.

### Recommendations

- Split into parts, in this order: (1) records for a package issue: settle where they live and add the lookup, as the first consumer of #393 (or fold into #393 PR 2); (2) worktree creation and phase dispatch from a project-rooted session on a package issue, using the `.worktree-repos` manifest, including how `--layer` and `--package-repos` are chosen; (3) the package pull request path: publish target, review reading the package diff, `merge_pr.sh` gate and cleanup across the manifest repositories; (4) rewrite the `run-issue` Scope entries, the design sections and add the end-to-end synthetic sandbox test. Parts 2 and 3 can run in parallel after part 1; part 4 closes.
- Add to the issue body (or the part 1 plan) the owner decision on records location for a package issue, as an owner question stated at goal level: should the work plan and timeline of a package issue be committed in the package repository (the owner of the code, visible to its other contributors) or kept at the project root outside it, since the package repository may not use this workspace? Everything else (qualified directory name, manifest handling, gate behaviour) is mechanism and is decided from the existing design.
- Decide in the plan, from existing design and not by asking: the pull request targets the package repository named in `owner/repo#N`; the review reads that repository's diff against its base; the gate stays report-only for package pull requests as the Merge gate section already says, unless the records move makes it enforceable.
- State `--layer` and `--package-repos` selection for a run started with only an issue reference: the adapter requires both, so `run-issue` needs a rule (infer the layer from the manifest and use the issue's repository alone) or the issue must carry them; the issue's text does not say.
- Amend #393's "Unsettled" line on package issues so the two issues do not contradict.
- Keep tests on the synthetic sandbox (hosting directory, two package repositories, bare remotes, a stubbed `gh`); the real-project run is the owner's acceptance run after part 4, as for #423.

## Checkpoint
**Status**: complete
**When**: 2026-11-10 10:20 -05:00
**By**: Claude Code Agent (claude-fable-5-2)
**Decided-by**: owner
**After**: issue-actions
**Decision**: proceed

The host asked where a package issue's work plan and timeline are kept. The owner's answer, verbatim: "Did we not already settle on 3 for this? It's configurable so that projects that want to keep it in the repo can and projects where we don't want to leave a footprint, we can pick a different location. I think we might also have settled defaults that can get overridden for both cases right?"

He is right: `docs/design.md`, Worktrees, Target records the per-project records settings (`location`, `location_path`, `tracking`) with defaults in one function (`project_records_default`), and issue 393 (records lookup) is the work that makes the other combinations honoured. The question should not have reached him (host defect: the review quoted these settings and the host asked anyway). A package issue's records follow the project's records settings. Host decisions for the plan, listed for his veto: the split into parts stays on this issue as separate pull requests, no new issues; part 1 builds the records lookup of issue 393 with a package issue as a consumer, and amends issue 393's "package issues stay without a timeline" line through the pull request text rather than by editing that issue.

## Plan Authored
**Status**: complete
**When**: 2026-11-10 09:58 -05:00
**By**: Claude Code Agent (claude-sonnet-5-5)
**Plan**: `.agent/work-plans/issue-429/plan.md` at `69995a5b`

Four parts on this issue, each its own pull request. Part 1 builds the records lookup of 393 with a package issue as consumer, honouring only (project, project) and keeping the other combinations refused; parts 2 to 4 are outlined.
